# Flash-KMeans (C++/CUDA + nanobind)

Fast, memory-efficient exact K-Means clustering. This branch is a rewrite of
the original Triton implementation: **all numerical work — the assignment
kernels, the centroid update, the k-means iteration loop and the large-N
streaming pipeline — is implemented in C++/CUDA** and exposed to Python through
[nanobind](https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind). The Python layer is a thin
marshalling shim that keeps the original public API (``batch_kmeans_Euclid``,
``FlashKMeans``, ``kmeans_largeN``, ...) unchanged.

## Design

```
flash_kmeans/            # thin Python layer: pointer/shape/dtype marshalling
  ops.py                 #   batch_kmeans_*, assign/update wrappers
  interface.py           #   FlashKMeans estimator
src/
  flash_kmeans.h         # public C++ API
  kmeans_common.cuh      # CUDA kernels (assign, accumulate, finalize, rng, ...)
  assign_wmma.cuh        # tensor-core (WMMA) assignment for fp16/bf16
  kmeans_launch.cuh      # launch configuration (shared-memory aware)
  kmeans_impl.cu         # batched k-means host loop, assign / centroid update
  large_n.cu             # CPU -> GPU chunked streaming, optional multi-GPU
  bindings.cpp           # nanobind module: _flash_kmeans_cpp
```

The assignment kernel never materialises an ``(N, K)`` distance matrix: a
thread block stages an ``x`` tile in shared memory and streams over the
centroids, computing ``||x - c||^2 = ||x||^2 - 2 x·c + ||c||^2`` with fp32
accumulation (vectorised for 2-byte dtypes, scalar for fp32 / odd ``D``).
Feature dimensions that do not fit in shared memory fall back to a
global-memory variant automatically; the launch configuration is derived from
the device's shared-memory limits at runtime.

### Supported hardware and dtypes

* Architectures: Pascal (GTX 1070, `sm_61`), Turing, Ampere, Ada (RTX 4090,
  `sm_89`), Blackwell (RTX 5090, `sm_120`), plus `sm_120` PTX for future GPUs.
  Override with the `CUDAARCHS` environment variable, e.g.
  `CUDAARCHS=89 pixi run build`.
* dtypes: `float32`, `float16`, `bfloat16` (bf16 uses portable bit-manipulation
  conversions so it also runs on pre-Ampere cards).
* `kmeans_largeN` streams CPU-resident data through the GPU in `BLOCK_N` chunks
  with double-buffered H2D transfers, and partitions the work across all visible
  GPUs (`device=None`) with a manual gather-reduce-broadcast AllReduce.

## Build

The repository ships a [pixi](https://pixi.sh) setup with two environments:

* `default` -- build toolchain only (CUDA 12.8 nvcc, CMake, ninja, nanobind,
  scikit-build-core).  The extension itself is torch-free.
* `equiv` -- adds the optional test dependencies (PyTorch cu128, Triton,
  numpy, pytest, tqdm) used for the Python marshalling layer, the functional
  equivalence checks against the original Triton implementation and the
  performance suite.

```bash
pixi install                     # create both environments
pixi run build                   # build the nanobind extension (default env)
pixi run -e equiv build          # build inside the equivalence/dev env
pixi run -e equiv test           # run the test suite
```

Or from source with a system CUDA toolkit (12.8+ for `sm_120`):

```bash
pip install .
# different targets:
CUDAARCHS="61-real;89-real;120-real" pip install .
```

> The GTX 1070 additionally needs a driver that supports the CUDA 12.x runtime
> (≥ 525). The kernels themselves are compiled to `sm_61` SASS.

## Performance

On an RTX 5090 with `B=32, N=74256, D=128, K=1000`, fp16, over 5 full
iterations (assignment + update + loop overhead):

| implementation                        | ms / iteration | TFLOP/s |
|---------------------------------------|---------------:|--------:|
| this rewrite (C++/CUDA, mma path)     |           ~4.6 |   130   |
| original Triton (`tl.dot`)            |            7.7 |    79.3 |

Assignment-only throughput by feature dimension (same shapes):

| D   | ms     | TFLOP/s | kernel                          |
|----:|-------:|--------:|---------------------------------|
| 32  |   2.8  |    54   | tensor cores (mma.m16n8k16)     |
| 64  |   3.3  |    93   | tensor cores (mma.m16n8k16)     |
| 128 |   4.7  |   129   | tensor cores (mma.m16n8k16)     |
| 256 |   9.0  |   136   | tensor cores (mma.m16n8k16)     |
| 512 |  21.8  |   112   | tensor cores (mma.m16n8k16)     |

Feature dimensions above 512 (and non-instantiated ones) fall back to the
generic shared-memory kernels, which are much slower (e.g. `D=1024` fp16 runs
at ~0.6 TFLOP/s); extending the mma design with a D-streamed A operand is the
natural next step.

Three assignment backends are dispatched automatically:

* **Tensor cores, hand-written `mma.m16n8k16`** (fp16/bf16, sm_80+, and `D` in
  `{32, 64, 128, 256, 512}`): each warp owns 16 points whose A operands live in
  registers for the whole K loop; centroid tiles are staged through padded
  shared memory with `cp.async` double buffering; the argmin/argmax runs on the
  accumulator fragments in registers and is reduced across the 4 lanes of each
  row group.  This is the fastest path and beats the original Triton kernel.
* **WMMA** (fp16/bf16, `D % 16 == 0`, sm_80+, shared-memory budget fits): a
  64-point x tile with double-buffered centroid tiles and an in-shared argmin
  epilogue.  Used for dimensions the mma path does not instantiate.
* **SIMT register tiles** (fp32, odd/non-power-of-two `D <= 512`, everything
  else): the x row is kept in fp32 registers (shared by `SPLIT` lanes per
  point) and centroid tiles stream through padded shared memory with
  conflict-free bank access.  Larger dimensions use a shared-memory tile
  kernel with a global-memory fallback.

`FK_DISABLE_MMA=1` / `FK_DISABLE_WMMA=1` force the fallbacks (useful for
benchmarking, and the test suite exercises both the tensor-core and SIMT paths).

### Profiling and performance regression tests

```bash
FLASH_KMEANS_PROFILE=1 pixi run -e equiv python benchmarks/bench_kmeans.py
pixi run -e equiv bench              # timing table for standard configurations
pixi run -e equiv bench-update      # refresh tests/perf_baselines.json
pixi run -e equiv perf              # regression check against the baseline
```

`FLASH_KMEANS_PROFILE=1` enables CUDA-event instrumentation inside the C++
batch loop and prints a per-phase breakdown (`convert`, `csq`, `assign`,
`accumulate`, `finalize`, `sync`).  On the fp16 `D=128` benchmark the
assignment kernel accounts for ~95% of the iteration time.

## Usage

```python
import torch
from flash_kmeans import batch_kmeans_Euclid

x = torch.randn(32, 75600, 128, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)
cluster_ids, centers, n_iters = batch_kmeans_Euclid(
    x, n_clusters=1000, tol=1e-4, verbose=True
)
```

The `faiss`/`sklearn`-style estimator keeps its original surface:

```python
from flash_kmeans import FlashKMeans

km = FlashKMeans(d=128, k=1000, niter=25, dtype=torch.float16)
labels = km.fit_predict(x)          # (B, N) int32
km.predict(x)                       # assignment against the stored centroids
```

Large CPU-resident data (chunked streaming, all GPUs when `device=None`):

```python
import torch
from flash_kmeans import kmeans_largeN

x = torch.randn(100_000_000, 128, pin_memory=True)
labels, centroids = kmeans_largeN(x, n_clusters=8192, max_iters=100, tol=-1)
```

## Functional equivalence

The rewrite is validated against the original implementation with two test
suites:

* `tests/test_equivalence_triton.py` runs the **original Triton package in a
  subprocess** and compares, per mode (euclid/cosine/dot) and dtype:
  * single-iteration assignment agreement (kernel-level equivalence),
  * the clustering objective (inertia) after multiple iterations,
  * the converged partition overlap,
  * the assignment and centroid-update kernels in isolation,
  * the `kmeans_largeN` streaming path.
* `tests/test_equivalence_torch.py` compares against a pure-PyTorch reference
  and covers dimension edge cases (`D` odd, non-power-of-two, `D > 512`),
  empty clusters, convergence and seeded random initialization.
* `tests/test_golden.py` replays frozen outputs produced by the upstream
  Triton implementation (`tests/data/golden_*.pt`, regenerated with
  `tests/_generate_golden.py`), so equivalence stays covered even without the
  upstream checkout.
* `tests/test_perf_regression.py` guards the assignment/iteration timings
  against the records in `tests/perf_baselines.json` (run with `pixi run perf`,
  refresh with `pixi run bench-update`).

Point the Triton tests at any upstream checkout:

```bash
FLASH_KMEANS_REF_REPO=/path/to/flash-kmeans pixi run test
```

Notes on numerical behaviour:

* Random initialization is implemented in C++ (splitmix64 based) with a
  `seed` parameter, so runs are reproducible but *not bit-identical* to
  `torch.randint`-based initialization used by the original.
* Centroid accumulation uses fp32 `atomicAdd`; summation order may vary between
  runs, which is visible only at fp32 round-off level. Long k-means runs are
  chaotic, so equivalence is asserted on the reached objective and partition
  overlap rather than bit-exactness.
* `kmeans_largeN` returns the updated centroids together with the labels of the
  last assignment, matching the original semantics exactly.
